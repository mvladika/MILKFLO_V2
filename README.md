# MilkFlo
This application was created with the new parent in mind. The idea came from having a new born child of my own. His mother decided to try breast feeding, which included having to pump milk and store it for when she was not around to feed him. That is where MilkFlo comes in. Not only can a new mother track pumping sessions but she can also track milestones accomplished by her newborn baby. 

## Initial Launch
Upon the initial launch of the application, a user is prompted to log into their account. If an account is not yet created they will have to click the create account button.

## Lactation Log
Once a user is logged in, the main function of this application is keeping track of lactation logs. Each log is saved and can be referred back to at any time by going to the specific date you are looking for.

## Secondary Functionality
More than just keeping track of lactation amounts, a new mother/parent can keep track of common milestones accomplished by their new baby. Their home page is also populated with their most recent lactation log entry. As for the profile section of the application, this is used to display personal information that was used to create the account, display notifications that would have been implemented given more time on the project, display milestones that were completed by their newborn child, and display a sign out button.

## Creation
This application was created during my time studying Computer Science at Full Sail University. I was in a small group of three total developers and we were given one month to design paper prototypes then another two months to get the application created. This included creating and implementing our Firebase database within Android Studio to store user information along with lactation log information.
